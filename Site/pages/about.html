I used the bootstrap blank template to start this so they get credit for that I guess.

			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Ethan Szlovak, the co-founder has been saddened by the damaging of many lakes he grew up to love; together with Christopher Lea who has an economic and financial background running other companies, they created Lake and River Ecology to aid with restoration of lakes containing harmful algae blooms (HAB). They have spent an adequate amount of time reviewing research literaturs and have found a prominent, scientifically-backed, result-yielding method. The method not only cleans up HAB but also provides a spike in  <a href="daphnia_repopulation.html">Daphnia</a> Repopulation, providing a slight boost to the fish population, potentially enhnacing the local economy temporarily. Simeon Florea has a Chemistry background (both inorganic and organic) which allows for the proper preparation of the method ensuring safety and efficacy is maintained.</p>
