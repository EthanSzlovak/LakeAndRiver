I used the bootstrap blank template to start this so they get credit for that I guess.

			<h1>What are Daphnia?</h1>
			<p>Daphnia are a common species of cladoceran that primarily subsist by filterfeeding on phytoplankton. They can be found in nearly any freshwater body of water, and typically range in size from 0.5 to 3 millimeters. Daphnia are remarkable because of two things: Firstly, they exhibit remarkable adaptability, with physical changes to their bodies taking place over a few generations in the presence of predators in order to ensure their survival, and secondly they have the ability to subsist on normally toxic strains of cyanobacteria, allowing them to eat it when other creatures cannot.</p>

			<h1>Why are they important?</h1>
			<p>Daphnia are a key component in the life cycle of fish, being a staple in the diet of small fish fry. As they take a place in one of the lowest trophic levels, they are also indirectly key to the diet of many higher organisms, such as waterfowl, amphibian tadpoles, crayfish larvae (Astacoidea and Parastacoidea), and other higher carnivorous mammals. However, there has been a significant and marked decrease in Daphnia population in the Great Lakes due to anthropogenic acidification and increased natural predation, which has significantly damaged both their adult population and their ability to reproduce at optimal rates, putting them in an endagered state. The critical situation with the Daphnia population in the Great Lakes could be remediated through the creation of a hatchery that mass-produces them.
			</p>
			<p>
			Using proven techniques, we have mastered a process to repopulate native daphnia populations back to healthier levels. This would be beneficial to both the ecosystem on which this project is performed, and to any native fish species. By extension, this would benefit human populations that are living near bodies of water. Tourism would remain strong or rebound as increased daphnia populations help to provide a healthier ecosystem on multiple levels, such as recreational fishing and decreasing of harmful algal blooms
